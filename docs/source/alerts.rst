.. _Alerts:

Alerts
******

Each rule may have any number of alerts attached to it. Alerts are subclasses of ``Alerter`` and are passed
a dictionary, or list of dictionaries, from ElastAlert 2 which contain relevant information. They are configured
in the rule configuration file similarly to rule types.

To set the alerts for a rule, set the ``alert`` option to the name of the alert, or a list of the names of alerts:

``alert: email``

or

.. code-block:: yaml

    alert:
      - alerta
      - alertmanager
      - chatwork
      - command
      - datadog
      - debug
      - dingtalk
      - discord
      - email
      - exotel
      - gitter
      - googlechat
      - gelf
      - hivealerter
      - indexer
      - iris
      - jira
      - lark
      - linenotify
      - matrixhookshot
      - mattermost
      - ms_teams
      - ms_power_automate
      - opsgenie
      - pagerduty
      - pagertree
      - post
      - post2
      - rocketchat
      - servicenow
      - ses
      - slack
      - sns
      - stomp
      - telegram
      - tencent_sms
      - twilio
      - victorops
      - workwechat
      - zabbix

Options for each alerter can either defined at the top level of the YAML file, or nested within the alert name, allowing for different settings
for multiple of the same alerter. For example, consider sending multiple emails, but with different 'To' and 'From' fields:

.. code-block:: yaml

    alert:
     - email
    from_addr: "no-reply@example.com"
    email: "customer@example.com"

versus

.. code-block:: yaml

    alert:
     - email:
         from_addr: "no-reply@example.com"
         email: "customer@example.com"
     - email:
         from_addr: "elastalert@example.com""
         email: "devs@example.com"

If multiple of the same alerter type are used, top level settings will be used as the default and inline settings will override those
for each alerter.

Alert Subject
=============

E-mail subjects, Jira issue summaries, PagerDuty alerts, or any alerter that has a "subject" can be customized by adding an ``alert_subject``
that contains a custom summary.
It can be further formatted using standard Python formatting syntax::

    alert_subject: "Issue {0} occurred at {1}"

The arguments for the formatter will be fed from the matched objects related to the alert.
The field names whose values will be used as the arguments can be passed with ``alert_subject_args``::


    alert_subject_args:
    - issue.name
    - "@timestamp"

It is mandatory to enclose the ``@timestamp`` field in quotes since in YAML format a token cannot begin with the ``@`` character. Not using the quotation marks will trigger a YAML parse error.

In case the rule matches multiple objects in the index, only the first match is used to populate the arguments for the formatter.

If the field(s) mentioned in the arguments list are missing, the email alert will have the text ``alert_missing_value`` in place of its expected value. This will also occur if ``use_count_query`` is set to true.

Alert Content
=============

There are several ways to format the body text of the various types of events. In EBNF::

    rule_name           = name
    alert_text          = alert_text
    ruletype_text       = Depends on type
    top_counts_header   = top_count_key, ":"
    top_counts_value    = Value, ": ", Count
    top_counts          = top_counts_header, LF, top_counts_value
    field_values        = Field, ": ", Value

Similarly to ``alert_subject``, ``alert_text`` can be further formatted using Jinja2 Templates or Standard Python Formatting Syntax

1. Jinja Template

By setting ``alert_text_type: alert_text_jinja`` you can use jinja2 templates in ``alert_text`` and ``alert_subject``. ::

    alert_text_type: alert_text_jinja

    alert_text: |
      Alert triggered! *({{num_hits}} Matches!)*
      Something happened with {{username}} ({{email}})
      {{description|truncate}}

Top fields are accessible via `{{field_name}}` or `{{_data['field_name']}}`, `_data` is useful when accessing *fields with dots in their keys*, as Jinja treat dot as a nested field.
If `_data` conflicts with your top level data, use  ``jinja_root_name`` to change its name.

2. Standard Python Formatting Syntax

The field names whose values will be used as the arguments can be passed with ``alert_text_args`` or ``alert_text_kw``.
You may also refer to any top-level rule property in the ``alert_subject_args``, ``alert_text_args``, ``alert_missing_value``, and ``alert_text_kw fields``.  However, if the matched document has a key with the same name, that will take preference over the rule property. ::

    alert_text: "Something happened with {0} at {1}"
    alert_text_type: alert_text_only
    alert_text_args: ["username", "@timestamp"]

By default::

    body                = rule_name

                          [alert_text]

                          ruletype_text

                          {top_counts}

                          {field_values}

With ``alert_text_type: alert_text_only``::

    body                = rule_name

                          alert_text


With ``alert_text_type: alert_text_jinja``::

    body                = rule_name

                          alert_text


With ``alert_text_type: exclude_fields``::

    body                = rule_name

                          [alert_text]

                          ruletype_text

                          {top_counts}

With ``alert_text_type: aggregation_summary_only``::

    body                = rule_name

                          aggregation_summary

ruletype_text is the string returned by RuleType.get_match_str.

field_values will contain every key value pair included in the results from Elasticsearch. These fields include "@timestamp" (or the value of ``timestamp_field``),
every key in ``include``, every key in ``top_count_keys``, ``query_key``, and ``compare_key``. If the alert spans multiple events, these values may
come from an individual event, usually the one which triggers the alert.

When using ``alert_text_args``, you can access nested fields and index into arrays. For example, if your match was ``{"data": {"ips": ["127.0.0.1", "12.34.56.78"]}}``, then by using ``"data.ips[1]"`` in ``alert_text_args``, it would replace value with ``"12.34.56.78"``. This can go arbitrarily deep into fields and will still work on keys that contain dots themselves.

Further, accessing subfields within a nested array structure is accomplished by specifying the subfield name directly after the array index brackets. 

For example, given the below data::

    {"data": { "items": [{ "name": "Mickey Mouse", "price": 24.95 }, { "name": "Winnie the Pooh", "price": 14.95 }], "tax": 2.39, "total": 42.29 } }

You would then access the fields as follows::

    data.items[0]name
    data.items[0]price
    data.items[1]name
    data.items[1]price
    data.tax
    data.total

Alerter Base Type
=================

For all Alerter subclasses, you may reference values from a top-level rule property in your Alerter fields by referring to the property name surrounded by dollar signs. This can be useful when you have rule-level properties that you would like to reference many times in your alert. For example:

Example usage::

    jira_priority: $priority$
    jira_alert_owner: $owner$


.. _alert_types:

Alert Types
===========

Alerta
~~~~~~

Alerta alerter will post an alert in the Alerta server instance through the alert API endpoint.
See https://docs.alerta.io/api/reference.html#alerts for more details on the Alerta JSON format.

For Alerta 5.0

Required:

``alerta_api_url``: API server URL.

Optional:

``alerta_api_key``: This is the api key for alerta server, sent in an ``Authorization`` HTTP header. If not defined, no Authorization header is sent.

``alerta_use_qk_as_resource``: If true and query_key is present, this will override ``alerta_resource`` field with the ``query_key value`` (Can be useful if ``query_key`` is a hostname).

``alerta_use_match_timestamp``: If true, it will use the timestamp of the first match as the ``createTime`` of the alert. otherwise, the current server time is used.

``alerta_api_skip_ssl``: Defaults to False.

``alert_missing_value``: Text to replace any match field not found when formating strings. Defaults to ``<MISSING_TEXT>``.

The following options dictate the values of the API JSON payload:

``alerta_severity``: Defaults to "warning".

``alerta_timeout``: Defaults 86400 (1 Day).

``alerta_type``: Defaults to "elastalert".

The following options use Python-like string syntax ``{<field>}`` or ``%(<field>)s`` to access parts of the match, similar to the CommandAlerter. Ie: "Alert for {clientip}".
If the referenced key is not found in the match, it is replaced by the text indicated by the option ``alert_missing_value``.

``alerta_resource``: Defaults to "elastalert".

``alerta_service``: Defaults to "elastalert".

``alerta_origin``: Defaults to "elastalert".

``alerta_environment``: Defaults to "Production".

``alerta_group``: Defaults to "".

``alerta_correlate``: Defaults to an empty list.

``alerta_tags``: Defaults to an empty list.

``alerta_event``: Defaults to the rule's name.

``alerta_text``: Defaults to the rule's text according to its type.

``alerta_value``: Defaults to "".

The ``attributes`` dictionary is built by joining the lists from  ``alerta_attributes_keys`` and ``alerta_attributes_values``, considered in order.


Example usage using old-style format::

    alert:
      - alerta
    alerta_api_url: "http://youralertahost/api/alert"
    alerta_attributes_keys:   ["hostname",   "TimestampEvent",  "senderIP" ]
    alerta_attributes_values: ["%(key)s",    "%(logdate)s",     "%(sender_ip)s"  ]
    alerta_correlate: ["ProbeUP","ProbeDOWN"]
    alerta_event: "ProbeUP"
    alerta_text:  "Probe %(hostname)s is UP at %(logdate)s GMT"
    alerta_value: "UP"

Example usage using new-style format::

    alert:
      - alerta
    alerta_attributes_values: ["{key}",    "{logdate}",     "{sender_ip}"  ]
    alerta_text:  "Probe {hostname} is UP at {logdate} GMT"

Alertmanager
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This alert type will send alerts to Alertmanager postAlerts. ``alert_subject`` and ``alert_text`` are passed as the annotations labeled ``summary`` and ``description`` accordingly. The labels can be changed.
See https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/clients/ for more details about the Alertmanager alert format.

Required:

``alertmanager_hosts``: The list of hosts pointing to the Alertmanager.

Optional:

``alertmanager_api_version``: Defaults to `v1`.  Set to `v2` to enable the Alertmanager V2 API postAlerts.

``alertmanager_alertname``: ``alertname`` is the only required label. Defaults to using the rule name of the alert.

``alertmanager_labels``: Key:value pairs of arbitrary labels to be attached to every alert. Keys should match the regular expression ``^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$``.

``alertmanager_annotations``: Key:value pairs of arbitrary annotations to be attached to every alert. Keys should match the regular expression ``^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$``.

``alertmanager_fields``: Key:value pairs of labels and corresponding match fields. When using ``alertmanager_fields`` you can access nested fields and index into arrays the same way as with ``alert_text_args``. Keys should match the regular expression ``^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$``. This dictionary will be merged with the ``alertmanager_labels``.

``alertmanager_alert_subject_labelname``: Rename the annotations' label name for ``alert_subject``. Default is ``summary``.

``alertmanager_alert_text_labelname``: Rename the annotations' label name for ``alert_text``. Default is ``description``.

``alertmanager_proxy``: By default ElastAlert 2 will not use a network proxy to send notifications to Alertmanager. Set this option using ``hostname:port`` if you need to use a proxy. only supports https.

``alertmanager_ca_certs``: Set this option to ``True`` or a path to a CA cert bundle or directory (eg: ``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt``) to validate the SSL certificate.

``alertmanager_ignore_ssl_errors``: By default ElastAlert 2 will verify SSL certificate. Set this option to ``True`` if you want to ignore SSL errors.

``alertmanager_timeout``: You can specify a timeout value, in seconds, for making communicating with Alertmanager. The default is 10. If a timeout occurs, the alert will be retried next time ElastAlert 2 cycles.
``
``alertmanager_resolve_time``: Optionally provide an automatic resolution timeframe. If no further alerts arrive within this time period alertmanager will automatically mark the alert as resolved. If not defined it will use Alertmanager's default behavior.
``
``alertmanager_basic_auth_login``: Basic authentication username.

``alertmanager_basic_auth_password``: Basic authentication password.

Example usage::

  alert:
    - "alertmanager"
  alertmanager_hosts:
    - "http://alertmanager:9093"
  alertmanager_alertname: "Title"
  alertmanager_annotations:
    severity: "error"
  alertmanager_resolve_time:
    minutes: 10
  alertmanager_labels:
    source: "elastalert"
  alertmanager_fields:
    msg: "message"
    log: "@log_name"

Additional explanation:

ElastAlert 2 can send two categories of data to Alertmanager: labels and annotations

Labels are sent as either static values or a single field value lookup. So if you specify the following::

    alertmanager_labels:
      someStaticLabel: "Verify this issue"
      anotherStaticLabel: "someone@somewhere.invalid"

    alertmanager_fields:
      myLabelName: someElasticFieldName
      anotherLabel: anotherElasticFieldName

The first labels will be static, but the two field will be replaced with the corresponding field values from the Elastic record that triggered the alert, and then merged back into the list of labels sent to Alertmanager.

Annotations are slightly different. You can have many static (hardcoded) annotations and only two annotations that will be formatted according to the `alert_text` and `alert_subject` [documentation](https://elastalert2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ruletypes.html#alert-subject). 

For example::

    alertmanager_annotations:
      someStaticAnnotation: "This is a static annotation value, it never changes"
      severity: P3

    alertmanager_alert_subject_labelname: myCustomAnnotationName1
    alertmanager_alert_text_labelname: myCustomAnnotationName2

    alert_subject: "Host {0} has status {1}"
    alert_subject_args:
    - http_host
    - status

    alert_text: "URL {0} has {1} matches"
    alert_text_type: alert_text_only
    alert_text_args:
    - uri
    - num_matches

AWS SES (Amazon Simple Email Service)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AWS SES alerter is similar to Email alerter but uses AWS SES to send emails. The AWS SES alerter can use AWS credentials
from the rule yaml, standard AWS config files or environment variables.

AWS SES requires one option:

``ses_email``: An address or list of addresses to sent the alert to.

single address example::

  ses_email: "one@domain"

or

multiple address example::

  ses_email:
    - "one@domain"
    - "two@domain"

``ses_from_addr``: This sets the From header in the email.

Optional:

``ses_aws_access_key``: An access key to connect to AWS SES with.

``ses_aws_secret_key``: The secret key associated with the access key.

``ses_aws_region``: The AWS region in which the AWS SES resource is located. Default is us-east-1

``ses_aws_profile``: The AWS profile to use. If none specified, the default will be used.

``ses_email_reply_to``: This sets the Reply-To header in the email.

``ses_cc``: This adds the CC emails to the list of recipients. By default, this is left empty.

single address example::

  ses_cc: "one@domain"

or

multiple address example::

  ses_cc:
    - "one@domain"
    - "two@domain"

``ses_bcc``: This adds the BCC emails to the list of recipients but does not show up in the email message. By default, this is left empty.

single address example::

  ses_bcc: "one@domain"

or

multiple address example::

  ses_bcc:
    - "one@domain"
    - "two@domain"

Example When not using aws_profile usage::

    alert:
      - "ses"
    ses_aws_access_key_id: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'"
    ses_aws_secret_access_key: "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
    ses_aws_region: "us-east-1"
    ses_from_addr: "xxxx1@xxx.com"
    ses_email: "xxxx1@xxx.com"

Example When to use aws_profile usage::

    # Create ~/.aws/credentials

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    aws_secret_access_key = yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

    # Create ~/.aws/config

    [default]
    region = us-east-1

    # alert rule setting

    alert:
      - "ses"
    ses_aws_profile: "default"
    ses_from_addr: "xxxx1@xxx.com"
    ses_email: "xxxx1@xxx.com"

AWS SNS (Amazon Simple Notification Service)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AWS SNS alerter will send an AWS SNS notification. The body of the notification is formatted the same as with other alerters.
The AWS SNS alerter uses boto3 and can use credentials in the rule yaml, in a standard AWS credential and config files, or
via environment variables. See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html for details.

AWS SNS requires one option:

``sns_topic_arn``: The SNS topic's ARN. For example, ``arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:somesnstopic``

Optional:

``sns_aws_access_key_id``: An access key to connect to SNS with.

``sns_aws_secret_access_key``: The secret key associated with the access key.

``sns_aws_region``: The AWS region in which the SNS resource is located. Default is us-east-1

``sns_aws_profile``: The AWS profile to use. If none specified, the default will be used.

Example When not using aws_profile usage::

    alert:
      - sns
    sns_topic_arn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:somesnstopic'
    sns_aws_access_key_id: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX''
    sns_aws_secret_access_key: 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'
    sns_aws_region: 'us-east-1' # You must nest aws_region within your alert configuration so it is not used to sign AWS requests.

Example When to use aws_profile usage::

    # Create ~/.aws/credentials

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    aws_secret_access_key = yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

    # Create ~/.aws/config

    [default]
    region = us-east-1

    # alert rule setting

    alert:
      - sns
    sns_topic_arn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:somesnstopic'
    sns_aws_profile: 'default'

Chatwork
~~~~~~~~

Chatwork will send notification to a Chatwork application. The body of the notification is formatted the same as with other alerters.

Required:

``chatwork_apikey``:  Chatwork API KEY.

``chatwork_room_id``: The ID of the room you are talking to in Chatwork. How to find the room ID is the part of the number after "rid" at the end of the URL of the browser.

``chatwork_proxy``: By default ElastAlert 2 will not use a network proxy to send notifications to Chatwork. Set this option using ``hostname:port`` if you need to use a proxy. only supports https.

``chatwork_proxy_login``: The Chatwork proxy auth username.

``chatwork_proxy_pass``: The Chatwork proxy auth password.

Example usage::

    alert:
      - "chatwork"
    chatwork_apikey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    chatwork_room_id: "xxxxxxxxx"

Command
~~~~~~~

The command alert allows you to execute an arbitrary command and pass arguments or stdin from the match. Arguments to the command can use
Python format string syntax to access parts of the match. The alerter will open a subprocess and optionally pass the match, or matches
in the case of an aggregated alert, as a JSON array, to the stdin of the process.

This alert requires one option:

``command``: A list of arguments to execute or a string to execute. If in list format, the first argument is the name of the program to execute. If passed a
string, the command is executed through the shell.

Strings can be formatted using the old-style format (``%``) or the new-style format (``.format()``). When the old-style format is used, fields are accessed
using ``%(field_name)s``, or ``%(field.subfield)s``. When the new-style format is used, fields are accessed using ``{field_name}``. New-style formatting allows accessing nested
fields (e.g., ``{field_1[subfield]}``).

In an aggregated alert, these fields come from the first match.

Optional:

``pipe_match_json``: If true, the match will be converted to JSON and passed to stdin of the command. Note that this will cause ElastAlert 2 to block
until the command exits or sends an EOF to stdout.

``pipe_alert_text``: If true, the standard alert body text will be passed to stdin of the command. Note that this will cause ElastAlert 2 to block
until the command exits or sends an EOF to stdout. It cannot be used at the same time as ``pipe_match_json``.

``fail_on_non_zero_exit``: By default this is ``False``. Allows monitoring of when commands fail to run. When a command returns a non-zero exit status, the alert raises an exception.

Example usage using old-style format::

    alert:
      - command
    command: ["/bin/send_alert", "--username", "%(username)s"]

.. warning::

    Executing commmands with untrusted data can make it vulnerable to shell injection! If you use formatted data in
    your command, it is highly recommended that you use a args list format instead of a shell string.

Example usage using new-style format::

    alert:
      - command
    command: ["/bin/send_alert", "--username", "{match[username]}"]

Datadog
~~~~~~~

This alert will create a `Datadog Event`_. Events are limited to 4000 characters. If an event is sent that contains
a message that is longer than 4000 characters, only his first 4000 characters will be displayed.

This alert requires two additional options:

``datadog_api_key``: `Datadog API key`_

``datadog_app_key``: `Datadog application key`_

Example usage::

    alert:
      - "datadog"
    datadog_api_key: "Datadog API Key"
    datadog_app_key: "Datadog APP Key"

.. _`Datadog Event`: https://docs.datadoghq.com/events/
.. _`Datadog API key`: https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#api-keys
.. _`Datadog application key`: https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#application-keys

Debug
~~~~~

The debug alerter will log the alert information using the Python logger at the info level. It is logged into a Python Logger object with the name ``elastalert`` that can be easily accessed using the ``getLogger`` command.

Dingtalk
~~~~~~~~

Dingtalk will send notification to a Dingtalk application. The body of the notification is formatted the same as with other alerters.

Required:

``dingtalk_access_token``:  Dingtalk access token.

``dingtalk_msgtype``:  Dingtalk msgtype, default to ``text``. ``markdown``, ``single_action_card``, ``action_card``.

dingtalk_msgtype single_action_card Required:

``dingtalk_single_title``: The title of a single button..

``dingtalk_single_url``: Jump link for a single button.

dingtalk_msgtype action_card Required:

``dingtalk_btns``:  Button.

dingtalk_msgtype action_card Optional:

``dingtalk_btn_orientation``:  "0": Buttons are arranged vertically "1": Buttons are arranged horizontally.

      - "dingtalk"
    dingtalk_access_token: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    dingtalk_msgtype: "text"


Example msgtype : markdown::

    alert:
      - "dingtalk"
    dingtalk_access_token: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    dingtalk_msgtype: "markdown"


Example msgtype : single_action_card::

    alert:
      - "dingtalk"
    dingtalk_access_token: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    dingtalk_msgtype: "single_action_card"
    dingtalk_single_title: "test3"
    dingtalk_single_url: "https://xxxx.xxx"


Example msgtype : action_card::

    alert:
      - "dingtalk"
    dingtalk_access_token: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    dingtalk_msgtype: "action_card"
    dingtalk_btn_orientation: "0"
    dingtalk_btns: [{"title": "a", "actionURL": "https://xxxx1.xxx"}, {"title": "b", "actionURL": "https://xxxx2.xxx"}]

Optional:

``dingtalk_proxy``: By default ElastAlert 2 will not use a network proxy to send notifications to Dingtalk. Set this option using ``hostname:port`` if you need to use a proxy. only supports https.

``dingtalk_proxy_login``: The DingTalk proxy auth username.

``dingtalk_proxy_pass``: The DingTalk proxy auth username.

``dingtalk_sign``: DingTalk HMAC secret, used for message authentication. See https://open.dingtalk.com/document/robots/customize-robot-security-settings for more information. Note that the algorithm provides authentication that *some* message was recently sent (within an hour) but does not authenticate the integrity of the current message itself. 

Discord
~~~~~~~

Discord will send notification to a Discord application. The body of the notification is formatted the same as with other alerters.

Required:

Email
~~~~~

This alert will send an email. It connects to an smtp server located at ``smtp_host``, or localhost by default.
If available, it will use STARTTLS.

This alert requires one additional option:

``email``: An address or list of addresses to sent the alert to.

single address example::

  email: "one@domain"

or

multiple address example::

  email:
    - "one@domain"
    - "two@domain"

Optional:

``email_from_field``: Use a field from the document that triggered the alert as the recipient. If the field cannot be found,
the ``email`` value will be used as a default. Note that this field will not be available in every rule type, for example, if
you have ``use_count_query`` or if it's ``type: flatline``. You can optionally add a domain suffix to the field to generate the
address using ``email_add_domain``. It can be a single recipient or list of recipients. For example, with the following settings::

    email_from_field: "data.user"
    email_add_domain: "@example.com"

and a match ``{"@timestamp": "2017", "data": {"foo": "bar", "user": "qlo"}}``

Grafana OnCall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://grafana.com/docs/oncall/latest/integrations/elastalert/

HTTP POST
~~~~~~~~~

This alert type will send results to a JSON endpoint using HTTP POST. The key names are configurable so this is compatible with almost any endpoint. By default, the JSON will contain all the items from the match, unless you specify http_post_payload, in which case it will only contain those items.

Required:

``http_post_url``: The URL to POST.

Optional:

``http_post_payload``: List of keys:values to use as the content of the POST. Example - ip:clientip will map the value from the clientip index of Elasticsearch to JSON key named ip. If not defined, all the Elasticsearch keys will be sent.

``http_post_static_payload``: Key:value pairs of static parameters to be sent, along with the Elasticsearch results. Put your authentication or other information here.

``http_post_headers``: Key:value pairs of headers to be sent as part of the request.

``http_post_proxy``: URL of proxy, if required. only supports https.

``http_post_all_values``: Boolean of whether or not to include every key value pair from the match in addition to those in http_post_payload and http_post_static_payload. Defaults to True if http_post_payload is not specified, otherwise False.

``http_post_timeout``: The timeout value, in seconds, for making the post. The default is 10. If a timeout occurs, the alert will be retried next time elastalert cycles.

``http_post_ca_certs``: Set this option to ``True`` or a path to a CA cert bundle or directory (eg: ``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt``) to validate the SSL certificate.

``http_post_ignore_ssl_errors``: By default ElastAlert 2 will verify SSL certificate. Set this option to ``True`` if you want to ignore SSL errors.

Example usage::

    alert: post
    http_post_url: "http://example.com/api"
    http_post_payload:
      ip: clientip
    http_post_static_payload:
      apikey: abc123
    http_post_headers:
      authorization: Basic 123dr3234

HTTP POST 2
~~~~~~~~~~~

This alert type will send results to a JSON endpoint using HTTP POST. The key names are configurable so this is compatible with almost any endpoint. By default, the JSON will contain all the items from the match, unless you specify http_post_payload, in which case it will only contain those items.
This alert is a more flexible version of the HTTP Post alerter.

Required:

``http_post2_url``: The URL to POST.

Optional:

``http_post2_payload``: A JSON string or list of keys:values to use for the payload of the HTTP Post. You can use {{ field }} (Jinja2 template) in the key and the value to reference any field in the matched events (works for nested ES fields and nested payload keys). If not defined, all the Elasticsearch keys will be sent. Ex: `"description_{{ my_field }}": "Type: {{ type }}\\nSubject: {{ title }}"`. When field names use dot notation or reserved characters, _data can be used to access these fields. If _data conflicts with your top level data, use jinja_root_name to change its name.

``http_post2_raw_fields``: List of keys:values to use as the content of the POST. Example - ip:clientip will map the value from the clientip field of Elasticsearch to JSON key named ip. This field overwrite the keys with the same name in `http_post2_payload`.

``http_post2_headers``: A JSON string or list of keys:values to use for as headers of the HTTP Post. You can use {{ field }} (Jinja2 template) in the key and the value to reference any field in the matched events (works for nested fields). Ex: `"Authorization": "{{ user }}"`. Headers `"Content-Type": "application/json"` and `"Accept": "application/json;charset=utf-8"` are present by default, you can overwrite them if you think this is necessary. When field names use dot notation or reserved characters, _data can be used to access these fields. If _data conflicts with your top level data, use jinja_root_name to change its name.

``http_post2_proxy``: URL of proxy, if required. only supports https.

``http_post2_all_values``: Boolean of whether or not to include every key value pair from the match in addition to those in http_post2_payload and http_post2_static_payload. Defaults to True if http_post2_payload is not specified, otherwise False.

``http_post2_timeout``: The timeout value, in seconds, for making the post. The default is 10. If a timeout occurs, the alert will be retried next time elastalert cycles.

``http_post2_ca_certs``: Set this option to ``True`` or a path to a CA cert bundle or directory (eg: ``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt``) to validate the SSL certificate.

``http_post2_ignore_ssl_errors``: By default ElastAlert 2 will verify SSL certificate. Set this option to ``True`` if you want to ignore SSL errors.

.. note:: Due to how values are rendered to JSON, the http_post2_headers and http_post2_payload fields require single quotes where quotes are required for Jinja templating. This only applies when using the YAML key:value pairs. Any quotes can be used with the new JSON string format. See below for examples of how to properly use quotes as well as an example of the new JSON string formatting.

Incorrect usage with double quotes::

    alert: post2
    http_post2_url: "http://example.com/api"
    http_post2_payload:
      # this will result in an error as " is escaped to \"
      description: 'hello {{ _data["name"] }}'
      # this will result in an error as " is escaped to \"
      state: '{{ ["low","medium","high","critical"][event.severity] }}'
    http_post2_headers:
      authorization: Basic 123dr3234
      X-custom-type: '{{type}}'

Correct usage with single quotes::

    alert: post2
    http_post2_url: "http://example.com/api"
    http_post2_payload:
      description: hello {{ _data['name'] }}
      state: "{{ ['low','medium','high','critical'][event.severity] }}"
    http_post2_headers:
      authorization: Basic 123dr3234
      X-custom-type: '{{type}}'

Example usage::

    alert: post2
    http_post2_url: "http://example.com/api"
    http_post2_payload:
      description: "An event came from IP {{clientip}}"
      username: "{{user.name}}"
    http_post2_raw_fields:
      ip: clientip
    http_post2_headers:
      authorization: Basic 123dr3234
      X-custom-type: {{type}}

Example usage with json string formatting::

    alert: post2
    jinja_root_name: _new_root
    http_post2_url: "http://example.com/api"
    http_post2_payload: |
      {
        "description": "An event came from IP {{ _new_root["client.ip"] }}",
        "username": "{{ _new_root['username'] }}"
        {%- for k, v in some_field.items() -%}
        ,"{{ k }}": "changed_{{ v }}"
        {%- endfor -%}
      }
    http_post2_raw_fields:
      ip: clientip

      {
        "authorization": "Basic 123dr3234",
        "X-custom-{{key}}": "{{type}}"
      }

IRIS
~~~~
The Iris alerter can be used to create a new alert or case in `Iris IRP System <https://dfir-iris.org>`_. The alerter supports adding tags, IOCs, and context from the alert matches and rule data.

The alerter requires the following option:

``iris_host``: Address of the Iris host. Exclude https:// For example: ``iris.example.com``.

``iris_api_token``: The API key of the user you created, which will be used to initiate alerts and cases on behalf of this user.

Optional:

``iris_customer_id``: This field represents the unique identifier of the customer for whom an incident/case will be created within the system. Configure and view the existing options in the section ``Advanced -> Customers`` of your IRIS instance. The default value is: ``1``

``iris_ca_cert``: Path to custom CA certificate.

``iris_ignore_ssl_errors``: Ignore ssl error. The default value is: ``False``.

``iris_description``: Description of the alert or case. If left blank and ``iris_type`` is ``alert`` (default value) description will automatically be generated utilizing the ``alert_text``, and optionally ``alert_text_args``/``alert_text_type``, field(s) to generate a description.

``iris_overwrite_timestamp``: Should the timestamp be overridden when creating an alert. By default, the alert's creation time will be the trigger time. If you want to use the event's timestamp as the ticket creation time, set this value to ``True``. Default value is ``False``.

``iris_type``: The type of object being created. It can be either ``alert`` or ``case``. The default value is ``alert``.

``iris_case_template_id``: Case template ID, if you want to apply a pre-prepared template.

You can find complete examples of rules in the repository under the 'examples' folder.

Jira
~~~~

The Jira alerter will open a ticket on Jira whenever an alert is triggered. You must have a service account for ElastAlert 2 to connect with.
The credentials of the service account are loaded from a separate file. Credentials can either be username and password or the Personal Access Token.
The ticket number will be written to the alert pipeline, and if it is followed by an email alerter, a link will be included in the email.

This alert requires four additional options:

``jira_server``: The hostname of the Jira server.

``jira_project``: The project to open the ticket under.

``jira_issuetype``: The type of issue that the ticket will be filed as. Note that this is case sensitive.

``jira_account_file``: The path to the file which contains Jira account credentials.

  For an example Jira account file, see ``examples/rules/jira_acct.yaml``. The account file is a YAML formatted file. 

  When using user/password authentication, or when using Jira Cloud the Jira account file must contain two fields:

  ``user``: The username to authenticate with Jira.

  ``password``: The password to authenticate with Jira. Jira cloud users must specify the Jira Cloud API token for this value.

  When using a Personal Access Token, such as when using a locally hosted Jira installation, the Jira account file must contain a single field:

  ``apikey``: The Personal Access Token for authenticating with Jira.

Optional:

``jira_parent``: Specify an existing ticket that will be used as a parent to create a new subtask in it

  For example, if you have this issue hierarchy:
    Epic
    Story, Task, Bug
    Subtask

  Then:
    As a parent issue, an epic can have stories, tasks, and bugs as subtask (child issues).
    As a parent issues, task, stories and bugs can have subtasks as subtask (child issues).
    A subtask can’t have any subtask (child issues).

  Example usage::

      jira_server: "https://example.atlassian.net/"
      jira_project: "XXX"
      jira_assignee: user@example.com
      jira_issuetype: "Sub-task"
      jira_parent: "XXX-3164"

``jira_assignee``: Assigns an issue to a user.

``jira_component``: The name of the component or components to set the ticket to. This can be a single string or a list of strings. This is provided for backwards compatibility and will eventually be deprecated. It is preferable to use the plural ``jira_components`` instead.

``jira_components``: The name of the component or components to set the ticket to. This can be a single string or a list of strings.

``jira_description``: Similar to ``alert_text``, this text is prepended to the Jira description.

``jira_label``: The label or labels to add to the Jira ticket.  This can be a single string or a list of strings. This is provided for backwards compatibility and will eventually be deprecated. It is preferable to use the plural ``jira_labels`` instead.

``jira_labels``: The label or labels to add to the Jira ticket.  This can be a single string or a list of strings.

``jira_priority``: The index of the priority to set the issue to. In the Jira dropdown for priorities, 0 would represent the first priority,
1 the 2nd, etc.

``jira_watchers``: A list of user names to add as watchers on a Jira ticket. This can be a single string or a list of strings.

``jira_bump_tickets``: If true, ElastAlert 2 search for existing tickets newer than ``jira_max_age`` and comment on the ticket with
information about the alert instead of opening another ticket. ElastAlert 2 finds the existing ticket by searching by summary. If the
summary has changed or contains special characters, it may fail to find the ticket. If you are using a custom ``alert_subject``,
the two summaries must be exact matches, except by setting ``jira_ignore_in_title``, you can ignore the value of a field when searching.
For example, if the custom subject is "foo occured at bar", and "foo" is the value field X in the match, you can set ``jira_ignore_in_title``
to "X" and it will only bump tickets with "bar" in the subject. Defaults to false.

``jira_ignore_in_title``: ElastAlert 2 will attempt to remove the value for this field from the Jira subject when searching for tickets to bump.
See ``jira_bump_tickets`` description above for an example.

``jira_max_age``: If ``jira_bump_tickets`` is true, the maximum age of a ticket, in days, such that ElastAlert 2 will comment on the ticket
instead of opening a new one. Default is 30 days.

``jira_bump_not_in_statuses``: If ``jira_bump_tickets`` is true, a list of statuses the ticket must **not** be in for ElastAlert 2 to comment on
the ticket instead of opening a new one. For example, to prevent comments being added to resolved or closed tickets, set this to 'Resolved'
and 'Closed'. This option should not be set if the ``jira_bump_in_statuses`` option is set.

Example usage::

    jira_bump_not_in_statuses:
      - Resolved
      - Closed

``jira_bump_in_statuses``: If ``jira_bump_tickets`` is true, a list of statuses the ticket *must be in* for ElastAlert 2 to comment on
the ticket instead of opening a new one. For example, to only comment on 'Open' tickets  -- and thus not 'In Progress', 'Analyzing',
'Resolved', etc. tickets -- set this to 'Open'. This option should not be set if the ``jira_bump_not_in_statuses`` option is set.

Example usage::

    jira_bump_in_statuses:
      - Open

``jira_bump_only``: Only update if a ticket is found to bump.  This skips ticket creation for rules where you only want to affect existing tickets.

Example usage::

    jira_bump_only: true

``jira_transition_to``: If ``jira_bump_tickets`` is true, Transition this ticket to the given Status when bumping. Must match the text of your Jira implementation's Status field.

Example usage::

    jira_transition_to: 'Fixed'



``jira_bump_after_inactivity``: If this is set, ElastAlert 2 will only comment on tickets that have been inactive for at least this many days.
It only applies if ``jira_bump_tickets`` is true. Default is 0 days.

Arbitrary Jira fields:

ElastAlert 2 supports setting any arbitrary Jira field that your Jira issue supports. For example, if you had a custom field, called "Affected User", you can set it by providing that field name in ``snake_case`` prefixed with ``jira_``.  These fields can contain primitive strings or arrays of strings. Note that when you create a custom field in your Jira server, internally, the field is represented as ``customfield_1111``. In ElastAlert 2, you may refer to either the public facing name OR the internal representation.

In addition, if you would like to use a field in the alert as the value for a custom Jira field, use the field name plus a # symbol in front. For example, if you wanted to set a custom Jira field called "user" to the value of the field "username" from the match, you would use the following.

Example::

    jira_user: "#username"

Example usage::

    jira_arbitrary_singular_field: My Name
    jira_arbitrary_multivalue_field:
      - Name 1
      - Name 2
    jira_customfield_12345: My Custom Value
    jira_customfield_9999:
      - My Custom Value 1
      - My Custom Value 2

TheHive
~~~~~~~

TheHive alerter can be used to create a new alert in TheHive. The alerter supports adding tags,
custom fields, and observables from the alert matches and rule data.

Required:

``hive_connection``: The connection details to your instance (see example below for the required syntax).
Only ``hive_apikey`` is required, ``hive_host`` and ``hive_port`` default to ``http://localhost`` and
``9000`` respectively.

``hive_alert_config``: Configuration options for the alert, see example below for structure.

``source``: Text content to use for TheHive event's "source" field. See the optional ``source_args`` parameter for dynamically formatting this content with dynamic lookup values.

``type`` Text content to use for TheHive event's "type" field. See the optional ``type_args`` parameter for dynamically formatting this content with dynamic lookup values.

Optional:

``tags`` can be populated from the matched record, using the same syntax used in ``alert_text_args``.
If a record doesn't contain the specified value, the rule itself will be examined for the tag. If
this doesn't contain the tag either, the tag is attached without modification to the alert. For
aggregated alerts, all matches are examined individually, and tags generated for each one. All tags
are then attached to the same alert.

``customFields`` can also be populated from rule fields as well as matched results. Custom fields
are only populated once. If an alert is an aggregated alert, the custom field values will be populated
using the first matched record, before checking the rule. If neither matches, the ``customField.value``
will be used directly.

``hive_observable_data_mapping``: If needed, matched data fields can be mapped to TheHive
observable types using the same syntax as ``customFields``, described above. The algorithm used to populate
the observable value is similar to the one used to populate the ``tags``, including the behaviour for aggregated alerts.
The tlp, message, and tags fields are optional for each observable. If not specified, the tlp field is given a default value of 2.

``hive_proxies``: Proxy configuration.

``hive_verify``: Whether or not to enable SSL certificate validation. Defaults to False.

``description_args``: can be used to format the description field with additional rule and match field lookups. Note that the description will be initially populated from the ElastAlert 2 default ``alert_text`` fields, including any defined ``alert_text_args``. See the "Alert Content" section for more information on the default formatting.

``description_missing_value``: Text to replace any match field not found when formatting the ``description``. Defaults to ``<MISSING VALUE>``.

``source_args``: List of parameters to format into the ``source`` text content, with values originating from the first match event.

``title``: Text content to use for TheHive event's "title" field. This will override the default alert title generated from the ``alert_subject`` and associated arg parameters. See the "Alert Subject" section for more information on the default formatting.

``title_args``: List of additional args to format against the "title" content. If the title argument is not provided then these optional arguments will be formatted against the already formatted title generated from the ``alert_subject`` and related parameters. This means that a two-phased formatting potentially could be utilized in very specific configuration scenarios.  See the "Alert Subject" section for more information on the default formatting. The values will be used from the first match event.

``type_args``: List of parameters to format into the ``type`` text content, with values originating from the first match event.

    alert: hivealerter

    hive_connection:
      hive_host: http://localhost

          value: example
      follow: True
      severity: 2
      status: 'New'
      source: 'src-{}'
      source_args: [ data.source ]
      description_args: [ name, description]
      description: '{0} : {1}'

      title: 'Title {}'
      title_args: [ data.title ]
      tlp: 3
      type: 'type-{}'
      type_args: [ data.type ]

    hive_observable_data_mapping:
      - domain: agent.hostname
        tlp: 1
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
        message: 'agent hostname'
      - domain: response.domain
        tlp: 2
        tags: ['tag3']
      - ip: client.ip

Twilio
~~~~~~

The Twilio alerter will send an alert to a mobile phone as an SMS from your Twilio
phone number. The SMS will contain the alert name. You may use either Twilio SMS
or Twilio Copilot to send the message, controlled by the ``twilio_use_copilot``
option.

Note that when Twilio Copilot *is* used the ``twilio_message_service_sid``
option is required. Likewise, when *not* using Twilio Copilot, the
``twilio_from_number`` option is required.

The alerter requires the following options:

``twilio_account_sid``: The SID of your Twilio account.

``twilio_auth_token``: Auth token associated with your Twilio account.

``twilio_to_number``: The phone number where you would like to send the alert.

Either one of
 * ``twilio_from_number``: The Twilio phone number from which the alert will be sent.
 * ``twilio_message_service_sid``: The SID of your Twilio message service.

Optional:

``twilio_use_copilot``: Whether or not to use Twilio Copilot, False by default.

Example with Copilot usage::

    alert:
      - "twilio"
    twilio_use_copilot: True
    twilio_to_number: "0123456789"
    twilio_auth_token: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345"
    twilio_account_sid: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567"
    twilio_message_service_sid: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567"

Example with SMS usage::

    alert:
      - "twilio"
    twilio_to_number: "0123456789"
    twilio_from_number: "9876543210"
    twilio_auth_token: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345"
    twilio_account_sid: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567"

WorkWechat
~~~~~~~~~~

WorkWechat alerter will send notification to a predefined bot in WorkWechat application. The body of the notification is formatted the same as with other alerters.

Required:

``work_wechat_bot_id``:  WorkWechat bot id.
``work_wechat_msgtype``:  WorkWechat msgtype. default to ``text``. ``markdown``

Example usage::

    alert:
      - "workwechat"
    work_wechat_bot_id: "your workwechat bot id"
    work_wechat_msgtype: "text"

Zabbix
~~~~~~

Zabbix will send notification to a Zabbix server. The item in the host specified receive a 1 value for each hit. For example, if the elastic query produce 3 hits in the last execution of ElastAlert 2, three '1' (integer) values will be send from elastalert to Zabbix Server. If the query have 0 hits, any value will be sent.

Required:

``zbx_sender_host``: The address where zabbix server is running, defaults to ``'localhost'``.

``zbx_sender_port``: The port where zabbix server is listenning, defaults to ``10051``.

``zbx_host_from_field``: This field allows to specify ``zbx_host`` value from the available terms. Defaults to ``False``.

``zbx_host``: This field setup the host in zabbix that receives the value sent by ElastAlert 2.

``zbx_key``: This field setup the key in the host that receives the value sent by ElastAlert 2.

Example usage::

    alert:
      - "zabbix"
    zbx_sender_host: "zabbix-server"
    zbx_sender_port: 10051
    zbx_host: "test001"
    zbx_key: "sender_load1"

To specify ``zbx_host`` depending on the available elasticsearch field, zabbix alerter has ``zbx_host_from_field`` option.

Example usage::

    alert:
      - "zabbix"
    zbx_sender_host: "zabbix-server"
    zbx_sender_port: 10051
    zbx_host_from_field: True 
    zbx_host: "hostname"
    zbx_key: "sender_load1"

where ``hostname`` is the available elasticsearch field.
